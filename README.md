# cybersecurity-threat-detection
Our project presents a scalable, real-time anomaly detection system for network logs using deep learning autoencoders and Apache Kafka. The system simulates network traffic, processes logs in real-time, and identifies potential security threats by detecting anomalies in user behavior patterns
